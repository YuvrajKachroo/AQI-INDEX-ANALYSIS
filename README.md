# AQI-INDEX-ANALYSIS

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard helps analyze and visualize air quality trends across different cities using AQI metrics, pollutant distribution, and health risk categories.
The goal is to convert raw AQI datasets into meaningful, actionable insights through clean data modeling and intuitive visual storytelling.

🎯 Objectives

✔️ Monitor city-wise AQI levels

✔️ Identify primary pollutants and their frequency

✔️ Visualize AQI category distribution

✔️ Track AQI trends over time

✔️ Support awareness and data-driven understanding of environmental conditions

🖥️ Dashboard Highlights
🔹 Key Features

City-wise AQI Comparison — identify most & least polluted cities

AQI Trend Over Time — month-wise variation visualization

AQI Category Gauge — real-time AQI condition indicator

Pollutant Occurrence Frequency — dominant pollutants & combinations

AQI Level Distribution — proportion of Good / Moderate / Unhealthy / Hazardous levels

Interactive Filters — Year, State, City selection
